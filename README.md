# checkcord
checkcord is a Discord bot that can jailbreak iOS devices remotely using checkra1n.

I was bored, ok?

## How to use

### Create the bot application

todo


### Run the bot


    git clone https://github.com/IntelligentPickle/checkcord
    cd checkcord-master
    npm install
    node .
   
### jelbrek!111!11

Once you have launched the bot, invite the bot to a Discord server using an OAuth url.
When it is invited, type 'checkra1n' into channel. checkcord will start the jailbreak!
